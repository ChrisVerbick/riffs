Riffs is a platform that empowers musicians to capture short song ideas, to share with other musicians, and to learn and improve the music of others.

Riffs began as a co-design project with a musician from Austin, Texas. Like most ideas, it started with a job to be done: "I'd love to have something like an effects pedal that makes it feel like I'm making music with someone that's not even in the room".
